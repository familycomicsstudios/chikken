## 3. Movement Rules
3.1. **General Movement.** Unless otherwise specified, every piece may move one square per turn in any direction.

3.2. **Piece-Specific Movement and Abilities:**

- **Push Ability:**  
  a. A Rooster may push one adjacent piece one square in the same direction as its movement. This can be horizontal or vertical.
  b. The act of pushing shall conclude the Rooster's turn, with the pushing being the last move the Rooster makes. Roosters can move any number of squares before pushing.

  d. A Rooster is prohibited from pushing a piece that is itself a Rooster or a Chicken.

### 3.2.3. Dog (d/D)
- **Movement:** A Dog may move to any square that is reachable by moving orthogonally (i.e., without moving diagonally) and without passing through any intervening pieces.

  a. A Dog may push any adjacent piece one square in any direction, other than other dogs.
